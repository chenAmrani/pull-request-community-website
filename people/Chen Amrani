  "description": "As a Computer Science graduate specializing in Full-Stack Development, I have hands-on experience with React, Node.js, TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Docker, AWS, and more.
  Throughout my studies and professional journey, I have developed REST API-based applications, real-time systems using Socket.IO, and cloud solutions with CI/CD pipelines. I am passionate about contributing to open-source projects, sharing knowledge, and learning from the community. 
Collaboration and teamwork are at the core of my approach, and I am always looking for new challenges where I can make an impact and grow as a developer."
